=========================
A temporary, static stub of my future home page.

Description
-----------
Possible backronym of site name is NIA's STacK, and it is titled as *NIA's stack of technologies.*

NIA is me. Stack of technologies means that I'm going to represent here all technologies that
I like to use, create and that creative technologies work inside me.
